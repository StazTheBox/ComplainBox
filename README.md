# ComplainBox
A simple Sponge Plugin for Complaining!
Well simple as in it doesn't do much. But it has a lot of code! :)

# Setup
Just pop it into your plugins folder and go!

# Commands
* / complain [user] [complaint]. Complain about the user and what they have done.
* /complaints complain [user] [user] - Alias to /complain
  * list [user] - View the complaints for this user. If user is omitted, view how many complaints everyone has.
  * clear [user] - Clear all complaints for this user. If user is omitted, clear all of the complaints.

# Permissions
* complainbox.list
* complainbox.clear
* complainbox.complain

# To Do
- Add more permissions (list only yourself, others, etc)

- Add configurable responses.

- Actions if someone gets too many complaints.

- Organize the code! It's a jumble, and it needs to be cleaned up. If you want to help, that'd be great!

- Add More options in the the configuration.
